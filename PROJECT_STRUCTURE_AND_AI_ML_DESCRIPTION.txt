AI-BASED TIMETABLE GENERATOR PROJECT STRUCTURE AND AI/ML DESCRIPTION

===============================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This is an AI-powered timetable generator that creates NEP 2020 compliant academic schedules for college classes. The system uses machine learning optimization techniques and AI-powered decision making to generate conflict-free timetables.

KEY TECHNOLOGIES:

Frontend:
- React with TypeScript for component-based UI
- Vite for fast development and build processes
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- React Router for navigation
- Lucide React for icons
- React Hot Toast for notifications

Backend:
- Supabase for database and authentication
- Express.js for API endpoints
- Node.js runtime environment

AI/ML IMPLEMENTATION:

1. OPENAI INTEGRATION:
   - Uses GPT models for intelligent timetable generation
   - Prompt engineering with comprehensive context:
     * Subject information with NEP categorization
     * Teacher profiles with specializations
     * Time slot configurations
     * NEP 2020 compliance requirements
     * Scheduling constraints and preferences

2. MACHINE LEARNING OPTIMIZATION:
   - Constraint Satisfaction Algorithms:
     * Teacher availability optimization
     * Room capacity management
     * Subject credit hour distribution
     * Student-to-teacher ratio balancing
   - Conflict Avoidance Systems:
     * Teacher scheduling conflict prevention
     * Class time slot overlap elimination
     * Room booking conflict resolution
   - Priority-Based Scheduling:
     * High-priority subjects in optimal time slots
     * Load balancing across the week
     * Resource utilization optimization

3. NEP 2020 COMPLIANCE FEATURES:
   - Multidisciplinary Integration: Combines related subjects
   - Holistic Development Focus: Balances different subject types
   - Flexible Curriculum Support: Adapts to various educational needs
   - Art & Value Education Priority: Ensures proper allocation

4. SMART ALLOCATION ALGORITHMS:
   - Subject Categorization: Groups subjects by educational type
   - Time-Based Optimization: Schedules subjects at research-backed optimal times
   - Resource Utilization: Efficiently uses classroom and teacher resources

AI/ML WORKFLOW:

1. Data Input:
   - Subjects with categories and priorities
   - Classes with student counts
   - Teacher profiles with specializations
   - Time slot configurations
   - Scheduling constraints

2. AI Processing:
   - OpenAI API call with engineered prompt
   - Context includes all NEP 2020 requirements
   - Constraint satisfaction optimization

3. Output Generation:
   - Conflict-free timetable
   - NEP 2020 compliant schedule
   - Optimized resource allocation
   - Downloadable PDF format

4. Feedback Loop:
   - Manual adjustments possible
   - Regeneration with modified constraints
   - Continuous improvement through user interaction

This system represents a hybrid approach combining rule-based constraint satisfaction with AI-powered optimization to create educationally effective and NEP 2020 compliant timetables.
